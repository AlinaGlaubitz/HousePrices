This is a contribution to the following Kaggle competition: Anna Montoya, DataCanary. (2016). House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques. Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

The modeling process involves comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features with a unique ordinal representation, and utilizing a Voting Regressor ensemble with tuned Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models. The chosen evaluation metric is the RMSE of the logarithm of predicted and actual sale prices, ensuring fair and balanced assessment across the entire price range, 
and the final predictions are exported for submission to the Kaggle competition. The score on the test data is **Score: 0.12770**.
